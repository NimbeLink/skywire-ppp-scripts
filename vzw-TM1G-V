# Description
# This file is the PPP file for the following modem:
# 		Skywire LTE CATM1 Verizon Modem: NL-SW-LTE-TM1G-V
#
# Instructions
# 	1. 	You will need to add your APN in the file: vzw-TM1G-V-chat
# 	2. 	This file is setup for PPP over UART. If you use USB, or if you UART
# 	    port enumerates differently it will be listed differently in /dev/.
#		Change the line:
#			/dev/ttyUSB0
#		to however the Skywire enumerates for you.
#
# Note
#   The "+ipv6" option allows PPP to work despite what is set with the
#   "AT+CGDCONT" command
#
